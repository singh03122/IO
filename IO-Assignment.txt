Q1. What is the Input and Output Stream in java ?

Ans:- 
      INPUT-STREAM:-
           
           An input stream is used to read data from a source. The InputStream class is the abstract superclass for all classes 
             representing an input stream of bytes. Some commonly used subclasses of InputStream include:

                  FileInputStream: For reading bytes from a file.
                  ByteArrayInputStream: For reading bytes from a byte array.
                  ObjectInputStream: For reading objects from a stream (used in serialization).



      OUTPUT-STREAM:-
   
          An output stream is used to write data to a destination. The OutputStream class is the abstract superclass for all
             classes representing an output stream of bytes. Some commonly used subclasses of OutputStream include:

                FileOutputStream: For writing bytes to a file.
                ByteArrayOutputStream: For writing bytes to a byte array.
                ObjectOutputStream: For writing objects to a stream (used in serialization).

Q2.  What are the meathods of output stream in java ?

Ans:-
        PRIMARY METHODS OF OUTPUT STREAM ARE:-
             
                 1.void write(int b)
                 2.void write(byte[] b)
                 3.void write(byte[] b, int off, int len)
                 4.void flush()
                 5.void Close()
              
                    these are the some meathods of  output stream in java.

Q3.  What is Serialization in java ?

Ans:-  Serialization in Java is a mechanism by which an object can be converted into a byte stream, making it possible to save 
       the object to a file or send it over a network. The reverse process, where the byte stream is converted back into a copy
       of the object, is known as deserialization. This is particularly useful for persisting the state of an object or 
       transmitting it between different components of a distributed application.
         
        How to Serialized an object :-
 
                            These are the following point to serialized an object :-
                   
                               To serialize an object, there are a few conditions to be met. Some other key points need to be 
                               highlighted before you proceed further in the article. These are the conditions and points to 
                               remember while using serialization in Java.

                          1. Serialization is a marker interface with no method or data member.
                          2. You can serialize an object only by implementing the serializable interface
                          3. All the fields of a class must be serializable; otherwise, use the transient keyword (more about it 
                              later).
                          4.The child class doesn’t have to implement the Serializable interface, if the parent class does
                          5.The serialization process only saves non-static data members, but not static or transient data  
                             members
                          6.By default, the String and all wrapper classes implement the Serializable interface

Q4.  What are  the Serializable Interface in java ?

Ans:-  The Serializable interface is a marker interface used to indicate that a class can be serialized. Serialization is the 
       process of converting an object's state into a byte stream so that the byte stream can be reverted back into a copy of the
       object.

Q5. What are the Deserialization in java ?

Ans :- Deserialization in Java is the process of reconstructing an object from a byte stream, which is the reverse operation of 
       serialization. During deserialization, the state of an object is restored from a previously serialized byte stream, 
       effectively reconstituting the original object.

Q6. How is serialization achieved in java ?

Ans :- Program to achieve serialization in java is :-
   
                   import java.io.BufferedInputStream;
                   import java.io.FileInputStream;
                   import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
                   import java.io.Serializable;

                      class Cricketer implements Serializable {
                         private String name;
                         transient int age;
                         private int runs;

                            public Cricketer(String name, int age, int runs) {
                             this.name = name;
                             this.age = age;
                             this.runs = runs;
                           }

            
                          }

                      }

                      public class LaunchSZ {
                       public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
                          System.out.println("Begin...");
                          Cricketer c = new Cricketer("Rohit", 20, 300000);
                           c.disp();

                          File f = new File("Ar.txt");
                          f.createNewFile();
                          FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("Ar.txt");
                          BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(fos);
                          ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(bos);
                          oos.writeObject(c);
                          oos.writeObject(c1);

                         oos.flush();
                         oos.close();

           }
}

  
          This  program also shared with the name of LaunchSZ.java . 


Q7.  How is deserialization achieve in java ?

Ans:- 
           These are the program to achieve deserialization in java :-
   
                    import java.io.BufferedInputStream;
                    import java.io.FileInputStream;
                    import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
                    import java.io.Serializable;

                    class Cricketer implements Serializable {
                      private String name;
                      private int age;
                      private int runs;

            public Cricketer(String name, int age, int runs) {
             this.name = name;
             this.age = age;
             this.runs = runs;
            }

          // for DESERIALIZATION
            public void disp() {
             System.out.println(name);
             System.out.println(age);
             System.out.println(runs);
                }

              }

                 public class LaunchDSZ {
                    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
                     System.out.println("Begin...");

                  // PROGRAM FOR DESERIALIZATION OF THE DATA

                    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("Ar.txt");
                    BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(fis);
                    ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(bis);

                      Cricketer cr = (Cricketer) ois.readObject();
                      cr.disp();

                       ois.close();

                    }
                 }
            
 
                     This  program also shared with the name of LaunchDSZ.java . 


Q8.  How can you avoid certain member variables of class from getting serialized ?

Ans:- 
          In Java, you can prevent certain member variables of a class from being serialized by using the transient keyword. When
           a field is declared as transient, it will not be included in the serialization process, meaning its value will not be
           saved to the byte stream. During deserialization, transient fields will be initialized to their default values (e.g.,
            null for objects, 0 for integers, etc.).


    program of it :-
              
                  import java.io.BufferedInputStream;
                  import java.io.FileInputStream;
                  import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
                  import java.io.Serializable;

                 class Cricketer implements Serializable {
                 private String name;
                 transient int age;
                 private int runs;

                 public Cricketer(String name, int age, int runs) {
                  this.name = name;
                  this.age = age;
                  this.runs = runs;
                     }

             // for DESERIALIZATION
                  public void disp() {
                    System.out.println(name);
                    System.out.println(age);
                    System.out.println(runs);
               }

             }

              public class LaunchDSZ {
                public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
                 System.out.println("Begin...");

        // PROGRAM FOR DESERIALIZATION OF THE DATA

                 FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("Ar.txt");
                 BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(fis);
                 ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(bis);

                  Cricketer cr = (Cricketer) ois.readObject();
                   cr.disp();
                   ois.close();

                 }
              }

Q9.  What classes are available in the javaIO file classes API ?

Ans:-   
       The Java I/O (Input/Output) API provides a comprehensive set of classes that handle input and output operations, 
         particularly for file manipulation. These classes are part of the java.io package. Below is a categorized list of the 
         main classes available in the Java I/O file classes API:

           Java File class is Java’s representation of a file or directory pathname. Because file and directory names have 
             different formats on different platforms, a simple string is not adequate to name them. Java File class contains 
             several methods for working with the pathname, deleting and renaming files, creating new directories, listing the 
             contents of a directory, and determining several common attributes of files and directories. 

               It is an abstract representation of files and directory pathnames.
                A pathname, whether abstract or in string form can be either absolute or relative. The parent of an abstract   
               pathname may be obtained by invoking the getParent() method of this class.

              First of all, we should create the File class object by passing the filename or directory name to it. A file system
              may implement restrictions to certain operations on the actual file-system object, such as reading, writing, and
              executing. These restrictions are collectively known as access permissions.

              Instances of the File class are immutable; that is, once created, the abstract pathname represented by a File 
               object will never change.

Q10.   What is the difference between Externalizable and Serialization interface ?

Ans :- 
         Difference Between Serializable and Externalizable in Java Serialization:-

              The process of writing the state of an object to a file is called serialization, but strictly speaking, it is the 
              process of converting an object from java supported form into a file-supported form or network-supported form by
              using fileOutputStream and objectOutputStream classes we can implement serialization. 

              But we can serialize only serializable objects. An object is said to be serializable if and only if the
              corresponding class implements a Serializable interface. Serializable interface is present in java.io package, and
              it doesn’t contain any method and hence it is a marker interface. If we are trying to serializable a non-
              serializable object then we will get Runtime Exception saying notSerializableException. 

      
              Program to understand  difference between Externalizable and Serialization :-
              
             // Java Program to illustrate Serializable

                   Importing utility classes
                   Importing input output classes
                   import java.io.*;
                   import java.util.*;

                   Class implementing serializable interface
                    class serializableDemo implements Serializable {
	
	           // Member variables of this class
	               String name;
	               int age;
	               int jobId;

	            // Default constructor
	             public serializableDemo(String name, int age, int jobId)
	          {
	           	// This keyword is used to refer
	              	// current object instance
	                	this.name = name;
	                	this.age = age;
	                 	this.jobId = jobId;
	           }

	            public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
	           {
 
	         	// Creating an object of class in main() method
	                	serializableDemo t1 = new serializableDemo("Ram", 34, 2364);

		// Serialization
    
		// Saving of object in a file
		FileOutputStream fos
			= new FileOutputStream("abc1.ser");
		ObjectOutputStream oos
			= new ObjectOutputStream(fos);
		oos.writeObject(t1);

		System.out.println("Object has been serialized");
		// Deserialization


		FileInputStream fis
			= new FileInputStream("abc1.ser");
		ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(fis);

		
		serializableDemo t2
			= (serializableDemo)ois.readObject();

		// Display message only
		System.out.println("Object has been deserialized ");
		System.out.println("Name:" + t2.name + "\n"
						+ "Age:" + t2.age + "\n"
						+ t2.jobId);
	}
